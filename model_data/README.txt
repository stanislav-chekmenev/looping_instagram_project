This directory contains YOLO's model data, coco_classes.txt and yolo_anchors.txt, which is needed to run the prediction
function.

-Also, you should download YOLO model from here:

-The model has been transformed by me from Darknet format into keras format, so it can be run in R-Keras. 
The weights of the model were pretrained on the COCO dataset, which is used in the applications such as 
autonomous driving, etc.
